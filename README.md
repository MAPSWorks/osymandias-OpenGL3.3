# Osymandias

[![Build](https://github.com/aklomp/osymandias/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aklomp/osymandias/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Osymandias displays the Earth as a 3D sphere, using OpenStreetMap tiles. It's
an OpenGL program for GTK+ 2 on Linux. There are no releases yet, and it
probably won't work out of the box in your environment.

I approached Osymandias as a personal programming challenge, and the code
reflects that: it's written by someone who is still finding his way around
OpenGL, threadpools, quadtrees, callbacks and other advanced topics. The code
is not in the most healthy state, but writing it did make me a much better
programmer. One day I hope to release it as a solid piece of work.
